# Cardiovascular Disease Predictor

## Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection can save lives. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on medical and lifestyle data. It demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter optimization.
